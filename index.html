              <p>Do We Really Understand Our Universe? By Saad Ahmad Sabri</p>
              <p>The Big Bang Theory is a popular theory in which scientists discovered the universe as we know it was constructed by large masses compressing and in turn producing a large bang separating the galaxies and solar systems we know. Although scientists began to establish this theory as true over the past decade, and relied on it to answer the pressing questions of curious individuals, recent advancements in technology have been able to detect galaxies that somewhat seem to rely outside of the constraints behind the big bang theory. 

	In order to really understand what these new studies suggest we must first look into what the big bang suggests and how it is explained/backed by evidence. According to wikipedia “The Big Bang event is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form. These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The overall uniformity of the Universe, known as the flatness problem, is explained through cosmic inflation: a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments. However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang”. In other words The Big Bang is backed by the explanation of models in which scientists study radiation, and structure behind properties within mass and light. The act of the “Big Bang” is then explained as a sudden and very rapid expansion of space, which was caused by thermal energy concentrating on one point within the universe.

	The Big Bang Theory is a theory that has decades of evidence and support, it also aligns with much of the physics and astronomical concepts that are supported by many renowned scientists, but it has its flaws. The Big Bang Theory has yet to be proven by many physics models and is limited by the reach of science. The main idea that scientists have yet to understand is that our understanding of nature, life and the universe grows as science progresses so it is unreasonable to put your beliefs into what science has “proven” or “explained” at a certain point in time. This idea not only prevents progression of our understanding of the universe but also increases the clash of egos, rather than scientific debates within the scientific world. 

The journal “Nature” was recently published and within it scientists posted findings which somewhat disproved ideas presented within The Big Bang. The main claim the scientist makes within the journal is tha galaxies found have been shown to be too large and too old to be established within the timeline presented by the big bang. In other words, these galaxies shouldn't exist if we take into account the ideas that are brought up based on past beliefs. According to NPR.org in a piece written by The Associated Press it was stated “Astronomers have discovered what appear to be massive galaxies dating back to within 600 million years of the Big Bang, suggesting the early universe may have had a stellar fast-track that produced these "monsters."
While the new James Webb Space Telescope has spotted even older galaxies, dating to within a mere 300 million years of the beginning of the universe, it's the size and maturity of these six apparent mega-galaxies that stun scientists. They reported their findings Wednesday.
Lead researcher Ivo Labbe of Australia's Swinburne University of Technology and his team expected to find little baby galaxies this close to the dawn of the universe — not these whoppers.

"While most galaxies in this era are still small and only gradually growing larger over time," he said in an email, "there are a few monsters that fast-track to maturity. Why this is the case or how this would work is unknown."

Each of the six objects looks to weigh billions of times more than our sun. In one of them, the total weight of all its stars may be as much as 100 billion times greater than our sun, according to the scientists, who published their findings in the journal Nature.“

	As someone who believes that the universe was created by a higher power, the ideas I bring forth may come across as biased. In reality the message and idea I am trying to bring forth is one I believe should be adapted into many ideas when speaking about the "Known” universe. The common misconception that scientists and astronomers understand the universe is one that has been ingrained in the hearts and minds of many unknowing people. Although I do believe that science does explain many concepts and ideas, when explaining something as large as the universe it really becomes more of an ideology rather than a proven fact. When humans are drawn to scale when it comes to even the observable universe we are smaller than an ant on a planet ten times the size of our earth. The realization that we know relatively nothing is one that must be taken into consideration. As one theory comes to light another may completely be disproven so adjusting our minds and beliefs to one specific detail shouldn't be how we approach science. Reserving our minds into the theory of a scientist on the same planet as us is foolish when considering the scope of the universe, it is up to yourself as a person to decide where your beliefs are placed, and to really open your mind to the illusion of what we really know. The truth is, when taking into consideration the only true setback for a theory to be accepted is by the judgment of other scientists with the same information, so if someone found evidence proving a concept it is up to scientists with the same information to “validate its truth”.

	In conclusion, as science progresses, is it really valid to shun one belief for another, especially taking into account that there is no real way to disprove one theory over the other. So as the Webb telescope, or the big bang theory are evaluated, it is important to look onto furthering knowledge rather than adapting one idea over the other
